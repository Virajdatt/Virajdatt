## :wave:	 Hello it's Virajdatt here!!

Graduate Student @ </br><img src="https://github.com/Virajdatt/Virajdatt/blob/main/penn_logo.png" width="120" height="80">

I passionately study and work on the entire machine learning lifecycle starting from data acquistaion to deployment and monitoring of the model. I have spent quality time on my projects in cleaning data, wranginling data, creating visuals and communicating the insights as a story easy to follow. Demonstrated experience completing data science projects and deploying machine learning models (Azure, GCP, AWS). I also have extensive expereince in building CI/CD and data pipelines with tools like AirFlow, Kafka, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes. I belive in making my data science work better by combining my software enginnering skills (DS, Algos, Unit and Integration Tests). 

## Skills I possess and work on continousily:

**Python**: pandas, sklearn, nltk, huggig face, tensorflow, tensorboard, beautiful soup, pytest

**SQL**   : MySQL, MS-SQL SERVER, POSTGRES

**NoSQL** : mongoDB

**Tools** : Airflow, Kafka, Comet-ML, MLFLOW, 

**Data Visuzalization**: Tabeleu, matplotlib, seaborn, 

**Cloud Tech**: Azure, AWS and GCP 

**Statistics**: Hypothesis testing, A/B Testing, Probablity

## Research intrests and working with:
1. Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
2. Machine Learning Enginerring Platform (MLOps)
3. Data Drift Detection
4. Telling visual stories using data (Tabeleu, python notebooks, comet-ml)

## This is what I do often here on github:
1. Build and publish Machine learning/ Deep learning models for (hackathons/ my passion projects/) with comments and report my findings.
2. Practice and Publish my Learnings in building data pipelines for Building ML/DL models.
3. Host my code for the articles I publish at [medium](https://kvirajdatt.medium.com/)
4. Learn and code cutting edge Deep Learning methods/models.

## Always open to collaboration, hit me up on twitter/linkedin
